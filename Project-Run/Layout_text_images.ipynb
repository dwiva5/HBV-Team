    "Rainfall runoff modeling is extremely important for hydrological science as it plays an huge role in understanding and managing water resources. The water cycle, containing factors such as precipitation and evaporation, contains many interactions between the atmosphere, the land surface and the river system. Understanding each of these factors and how they impact the river systems is extremely important. Especially in current times of climate change and urbanization that continues to reshape landscapes, there is a need for accurate and reliable rainfall runoff models. In the past years it has become increasingly apparent that the climate has been changing and that river systems have been impacted greatly in the forms of droughts or floods.\r\n"

    "However, until now rainfall predictions have been computed deterministically without providing any information about the uncertainty that plays a significant role in these predictions. It is crucial to quantify uncertainties in rainfall-runoff predictions for multiple reasons, as it provides stakeholders a better understanding of the the possible outcoems that could occur. Therefore it is crucial for decision-making in many sectors, for example water resource management, agriculture and disaster risk reduction. \n",

    "Machine learning has been widely used to produce accurate predictions for optimizing water allocation, flood control, and sustainable environmental practices. Machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools in the field of hydrological prediction, offering the potential to enhance accuracy and efficiency. Among these techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have gained prominence for their ability to model complex temporal dependencies in data. The application of LSTM models in hydrological prediction involves leveraging their capacity to analyze and learn patterns from historical hydrological data. By understanding the intricate relationships between various meteorological and hydrological variables, LSTMs can generate predictions that contribute to more informed decision-making in water resource management."
